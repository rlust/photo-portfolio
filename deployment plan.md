# PhotoPortfolio Web Application: Deployment Plan

## 1. Deployment Objectives
- Ensure secure, scalable, and reliable deployment of the PhotoPortfolio web application
- Enable continuous integration and delivery for rapid iteration
- Provide a seamless experience for end users with minimal downtime

## 2. Deployment Environment
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS, Azure, or GCP (select based on team preference and cost)
- **Containerization:** Docker for environment consistency
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar for automated build, test, and deployment
- **Web Servers:** Nginx or Apache as reverse proxy
- **Domain & SSL:** Custom domain with HTTPS (Let's Encrypt or cloud provider SSL)

## 3. Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Preparation
- Set up cloud hosting account and project
- Register custom domain and configure DNS
- Provision object storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Azure Blob) for image files
- Set up managed database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)

### Step 2: Application Build
- Build frontend (Vue.js/Nuxt.js or React) for production
- Build backend (Flask/Django or Node.js) and run migrations
- Create Docker images for frontend, backend, and supporting services
- Push Docker images to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Docker Hub)

### Step 3: Infrastructure Setup
- Deploy database and object storage resources
- Set up virtual machines or container orchestration (e.g., AWS ECS, Azure AKS, or GCP GKE)
- Configure environment variables and secrets (API keys, DB credentials)
- Set up Nginx/Apache as a reverse proxy for HTTPS termination and routing

### Step 4: Deployment Automation
- Configure CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment steps
- Enable automated rollbacks on failure
- Set up monitoring and alerts (e.g., CloudWatch, Azure Monitor)

### Step 5: Go Live
- Deploy application containers to production environment
- Run smoke tests and verify core functionality
- Enable HTTPS and force secure connections
- Monitor logs and performance metrics
- Announce launch to users

## 4. Post-Deployment
- Schedule regular backups for database and object storage
- Monitor uptime and performance
- Collect user feedback and address issues
- Plan for scaling (auto-scaling groups, load balancers)
- Schedule periodic security reviews and updates

## 5. Rollback & Recovery
- Maintain versioned Docker images for previous releases
- Automate rollback in CI/CD pipeline
- Document manual rollback procedures
- Regularly test backup and restore processes
