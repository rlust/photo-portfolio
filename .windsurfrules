Code Structure & Modularity

Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code. If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility. For agents this looks like:
agent.py - Main agent definition and execution logic
tools.py - Tool functions used by the agent
prompts.py - System prompts
Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).

Context7 MCP

Always use the Context7 MCP server to reference documentation for libraries like Google Cloud or other needed libraries.
For the tokens, always use 5000 tokens for your search.
Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation. If you don't get what you need, use the Brave MCP server to perform a wider search.
