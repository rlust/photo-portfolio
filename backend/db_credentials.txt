You can monitor the status and progress of your Cloud SQL instance (PostgreSQL) in the Google Cloud Console at the following URL:

Cloud SQL Instances Dashboard:
https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances?project=photo-portfolio-459415

Here, you will see all Cloud SQL instances in your project, including photoportfolio-db once it is provisioned.
Click on the instance name to view detailed status, logs, users, databases, and connection info.
You can also monitor CPU, memory, storage, and query activity from this dashboard.
